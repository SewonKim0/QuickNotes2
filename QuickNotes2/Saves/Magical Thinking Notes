		Similarity, contagion, mind over matter -> Luck, superstition, positive thinking

		Psychology of similarity association -> spurrious conclusions
			Metaphorical thinking
			Rationalize by previous knowledge
	Positive and negative implications
		Religious meaning (illusion of control) vs pseudoscience/conspiracy

	Magical thinking in (religion, secularism, science) dogmatist irony
		Usually in religious/superstitious context
		Nobody is immune

Clustering illusion: Imaginary patterns
apophenia: Expectancy effect
Referential thinking: Imaginary linking
Mere ownership effect: Fate/connection
Ommision bias: No trace explanation
Immanent Justice thinking: Result of actions
