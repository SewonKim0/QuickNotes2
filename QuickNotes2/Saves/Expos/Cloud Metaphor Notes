Power of metaphorical lang
	"Metaphors are encumbered with assumptions, and when people use metaphors, they embed those assumptions in the discussion"
	Metaphors are more than explanatory tools, they cause unconscious inferencing, primarily when we extract more from the metaphor than what it is intended to represent. Therefore, metaphors are capable of propagating misinformation through miscommunication, triggering false assumptions within the mind of the listener.

	"What’s more, metaphors matter because they shape laws and policies about data collection and use. As technology advances, law evolves (slowly, and somewhat clumsily) to accommodate new technologies and social norms around them."
	Legal world is actively constructed and impacted by metaphors
		Exemplifying the emotional contagion experiment to recognize the shifts in ethical perceptions to Facebook user manipulation in response to changing metaphors
	Implication: Legal world may be hindered to keep up with changing technologies, as a result of metaphorical misunderstanding
		Such inabilities may cause ethical holes in the legal world surrounding technology
Data metaphor
	"treats personal information as a natural, inexhaustible good—ripe for exploitation in the name of economic growth and private gain."
	As we symbolize data-related concepts as mere materials of the physical world to be utilized, we lose ethical concern for our use of data. This holds especially true when involving personal data, as we begin to commodify people by perceiving them as data extraction plants.
		Data exhaust: Metaphorize as byproduct vs new oil
		Cause ethical implications to be ommitted from our considerations
	Implicit idea: Going forward, data metaphors might become the destructors of individual privacy
