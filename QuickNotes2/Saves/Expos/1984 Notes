Intro
	You come back home from a long day of work. You are tired. You need rest. But, in your room lies the omnipotent telescreen, the destructor of the little privacy you had left in your living room. All of a sudden, on its screen appears a set of eyes, ears, and a mouth.
		1: You do not know when you are being monitored and therefore, you act on the assumption of being constantly watched.
		2: It demands not your obedience or subjectry, but the very transformation of who you are, you ideals, beliefs, and thoughts.
	The mouth starts to move, and it says: "big brother is always watching".
