Decisions (Intuition vs Reason)
	Sources of bias
		Act fast, What should remember?, too much info, not enough meaning?
	Expected Utility Theory: Odds * Benefit = Value
Limitations to Rationality
	Error of odds
		Sample size neglect: Small samples deviate more
		Availability bias: What we know is more likely
		Gambler's fallacy: It will change from prev result
		Conjunction fallacy: Additional conditions -> Less likely
		Planning fallacy: Longer than expected
	Error of value
		Presentism: Overvalue when in need
		Comparing to the past: Overly anchoring to past experience/knowledge
		Prospect Theory: Anti-risk
		Temporal Discounting (Delay of gratification): Take less earlier
		Endowment Effect: Losses loom larger than gains
Ladder of inference(concrete -> abstract)
	Observations, Attention, Interpretation, Inferences, Conclusion, Belief adjustment, Decision

Categories: Groups of objs (regularities, prediction)
	Hierarchical organization: Category tree
	Concrete entities, Abstract entities, Scientific entities, events
Concepts: How we think about categories
	Concepts associated with features

	Classical View
		Individual Necessary: Need all features
		Jointly Sufficient: Dont need anything else
			Problem: Typicality, features not defining
	Probabilistic View
		Family Resemblance structures: No feature necessary or fulfilling
		Feature strength: Probability of occurance
	Concepts-in-theories View
		Feature strength considers causal relations of features
Critical Thinking
	Formulate question
	Gather info
	Apply info
	Consider implications
	Explore other points of views

Development (nature AND nurture)
	Nature: Preformationism: Pre-formed babies
	Nurture: Exposure to lang improves lang
		Continuous: Gradual development
		Discontinuous: Can be divided into stages

	Freud: Psychosexual stages of development
		Oral (0-2), Anal(2-3), Phallic(3-7), latency(7-adol), genital(adol-adult)
			Stuck at a stage: comes back with disorder
		Fallacy: Children obsession with parents
	Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development
			Schema(concept), Assimilaton(integrate concept), Accommodation(revision), Equilibrium(balance)
		Sensorimotor(0-2): Self and environment
			Error: obj permanence
			Error: A not B fabric lifting
		Preoperational(2-7): Central focus
			Error: Conservation
			Error: Egocentricity(cant image diff perspective)
		Concrete Operational(7-11): logical
			Error: Cant do hypothetical
		Formal Operational Stage(11+): Abstract, hypothetical
	Attachment Theory: Bonds -> Better social ability
		Securely attached, anxious avoidant, anxious ambivalent, amxious disorganized
		Toxic Stress: Development disturber
