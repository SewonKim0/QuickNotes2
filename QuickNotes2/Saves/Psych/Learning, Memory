Learning: Modification of behavior by experience
	Respond (basic hardware)
		Sensation: Discriminal diff stimuli
		Reflex: Hardwared response to stimuli
		Habituation: Circuit breaker, < response from repeated exposure
	Predict(pavlovian software)
		Classical conditioning: Respond to neutral stimuli by associations
			Sloppily(generalize)
			Sparingly(blocking)
			Slowly(latent inhibition)
			Unlearn slowly(extinction)
			Relearn quickly(spontaneous recovery)
		Unconditioned(hardwired): stimuli, response
		Conditioned(predicted): stimuli, response

		Little Albert: Fear can be learned by conditioning association
	Operate(skinnerian software): Operant conditioning
			Ex: Cat in the cage, pigeon box
		Law of effect: Association +/- by result
			Repeat what works, optimize responses
		Req: Ratio(numBehaviors) / interval(time)
		Reward: fixed / variable
			Fixed Ratio: Buy 3 get 1
			Variable Ratio: Casino pull reward
			Fixed Interval: Monthly pension
				Respond more near reward time
			Variable Interval: Ticket giveaway
				Steady responding
Eugenics vs Behaviorism (nature vs nurture)
		Watson: Conditioning in advertising
	Radical Behavioralism (nurture only)
		Tabula Rasa: baby blank slate (not true)
	Biological preparedness hypothesis: Easy/Hard learns by hardwiring
		Easy Learns: Disgust, fear exposure
	Language can't be conditioned, hardwired to grammatical structure
Memory
	Sensory (Iconic: visual, echoic: auditory)
	Working (Conscious mem): short term
	Long Term
		Explicit(Semantic, episodic)
			Distributed representation: more meaning
			Lexical Decision task: Shows how words activate neurons
		Implicit(procedural, priming)

		Retrieval: Re-instantiate pattern by retrieval cue
			Levels of processing: Deepness of meaning (Deep incoding: highly distributed representation, more possible retrievals)
			Encoding Specificity: Retrieval must overlap with encoding
			Context dependence: Equal encoding/retrieval environments
		Stored in hippocampus
			HM(Hippocampus removal), persistence of procedural mem
			Retrograde/Anterograde amnesia
