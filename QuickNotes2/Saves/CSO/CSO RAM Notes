Random Access Memory (cells) as chip
	Multiple RAMs form a memory
		Static RAM (faster, lowStorage, more transistors): Cache mem
		Dynamic RAM (slower, highStorage): Main mem, frame buffers
	Random Access: Ability to directly go to pos
	Volatile (SRAM & DRAM): Lose if powered off, Nonvolatile (ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM)
	ROM(read only mem): System bootstrapper, cant be changed

	Bus(transportation wires): Needed for mem storage
		CPU(register, ALU(logic gates), BusInterface) - I/O Bridge - Main Mem
Magnetic Disk(nonvolatile): Physical manipulation markings on disk
	Read at head (counter-clockwise rotation)
	Move to pos: Rotate until reach
		CPU waits for rotation, CPU interruption
	SeekTime RotationalLatency

	Solid State Disk (electron storage)
		Flash translation layer
		FlashMem(Blocks(Pages)): Read by page/block
			Page can be written after block erased
			Block wears out from 100000 writes
Caching (smaller, faster, subset of the data) (cache hit, cache miss)
	Request: Find by HM(buckets, modKey)
	Save most recent copy blocks

	Cache Miss: ColdMiss(empty), ConflictMiss(bucketTaken), CapacityMiss(overflow)
Locality(proximity of memory)
	arr: cols in row > rows of col
Mem Hierarchy (Regs, caches, main mem, local disks, remote storage): Order of data checking
Access Times (CPU, SRAM, DRAM, SSD, Disk)
